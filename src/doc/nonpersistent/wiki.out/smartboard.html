The smartboard driver might support Cherry Smartboard keyboard, but its status is unknown and the original author has stopped working on it.

I have tested this board, it works well using the ccid driver.
I had to edit the /etc/openct.conf file and add a line usb:046a/0010 in the ccid section in order to get the keyboard recognized. I did not manage to use the securepinpad mode of the keyboard. 
I recommend this keyboard/reader for use with the Belgian eID under linux.

Some cherry usb keyboards implement the usb ccid norm, so they should work with the <a class="wiki" href="ccid.html" shape="rect">generic USB CCID driver</a>.
